Shoes are critical. Without it, severe injury of innocent children is frequent.

* Protect feet (against thorns, wear, dangerous animals, ...).
* The positive effect must outweight the negative effect, at times shoes are unhealthy, especially if manufcatured in a do-it-yourself way with almost no choice of materials but trash.
